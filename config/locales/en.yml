    # Append your own errors here or at the model/attributes scope.

      # The values :model, :attribute and :value are always available for interpolation.

      # For example,
      #   models:
      #     user:
      #       blank: "This is a custom blank message for %{model}: %{attribute}"
      #       attributes:
      #         login:
      #           blank: "This is a custom blank message for User login"
      # Will define custom blank validation message for User model and
      # custom blank validation message for login attribute of User model.
      #models:

    # Translate model names. Used in Model.human_name().
    #models:
      # For example,

    # Translate model attribute names. Used in Model.human_attribute_name(attribute).
    #attributes:
      # For example,
